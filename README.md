- 👋 Hi, I’m @marcelorsviana
- 👀 I’m interested in developing for Android using the Kotlin language.
- 🌱 I’m currently focused in learning Kotlin and Android, but whenever I have some free time I have an eye on learning html, css, javaScript, Java and Springboot.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project related to Android, which uses Kotlin.
- 📫 You can reach me through my LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcelo-r-s-viana/
